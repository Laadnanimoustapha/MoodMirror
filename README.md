# MoodMirror

MoodMirror is a simple web application that acts as your emotional dashboard. It allows users to share how they feelâ€”either by typing their mood or selecting from preset options (Happy, Sad, Angry, Lost). The app analyzes the user's mood using an AI (with a fallback to manual keyword detection) and responds with an empathetic, mood-specific message.

## Features

- **AI Mood Analysis:** Uses the Hugging Face API to analyze text input and detect emotions.
- **Manual Mood Detection:** Falls back to keyword-based analysis if the API is unavailable.
- **Mood History:** Records and displays a history of detected moods with timestamps in the browser's local storage.
- **Dynamic UI:** The appearance and messages adapt to the detected mood.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Enable AI
To use the mood-detection AI, you need a free Hugging Face account.
Get your API key from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
Paste it into ai.js where it says HF_API_KEY.

## How It Works

1. User enters their mood as text or selects from a dropdown.
2. The app analyzes the mood using AI or manual keyword matching.
3. A personalized response and visual feedback are shown based on the detected mood.
4. The mood and timestamp are saved to history for later review.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Hugging Face Inference API (for emotion detection)
